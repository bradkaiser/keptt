# Team Grouping
student team grouping  

To run the application, first make sure that python is installed. You can check your installation by typing in "python -V" into the command prompt or terminal. If you do not wish to install python, you can interact with our online version located at http://bradkaiser.github.io/teamgrouping/  

Once python is installed, start the python server by navigating to the project folder in the terminal and typing:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer  

The output of this should be "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000." This means that it's running on the current computer at port 8000.  You can now access the website by going to your web browser and going to the URL "localhost:8000" If for some reason the port is different that 8000, adjust the URL accordingly ("localhost:<portNumber>").
